### Project Overview
---
This project explores a retail store's sales data to gain insights into product performance, regional sales, and monthly trends. The analysis began with Excel, using pivot tables and formulas to identify key metrics and sales patterns. SQL queries were then used to uncover additional insights, including product category totals, top customers, and regional contributions. Finally, an interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visually represent the findings, helping to identify high-performing products and trends across different regions.

### Data Sources
---
The data for this project was provided in an Excel file titled "LITA Capstone Dataset.xlsx", containing detailed sales information by order ID, product, customer, and region. For SQL analysis, the data was converted to a CSV (comma-delimited) file for easier import into SQL Server

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
During the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, the following actions were performed:
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data Cleaning and formatting

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA questions focused on understanding sales trends, product performance, and regional contributions:

### Project Title: Sales Performance Analysis for a Retail Store

### Project Overview
This project explores a retail store's sales data to gain insights into product performance, regional sales, and monthly trends. The analysis began with Excel, using pivot tables and formulas to identify key metrics and sales patterns. SQL queries were then used to uncover additional insights, including product category totals, top customers, and regional contributions. Finally, an interactive Power BI dashboard was created to visually represent the findings, helping to identify high-performing products and trends across different regions.
